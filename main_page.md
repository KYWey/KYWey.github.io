# Hello, my name is Wey, Kuan-Yu (衛冠瑜)
  
## Research

I’m a PhD candidate at [Quantum Matter Design Studio](https://sites.google.com/g.ucla.edu/quantum/) in University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA). 
My research focuses on low-dimensional materials characterization. I specialize using scanning tunnelin microscope (STM) and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to probe the surface atomic-resolution image and band structure. My current research topic is **Probing the Atomic-scale Dynamics of a Quasi-1D Charge Density Wave System by in-plane Current-Tuned Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy (STM/STS)**. The project uses STM ... 

On the page [STM and ARPES](https://kywey.github.io/Instrument_intro/) I'm attaching some useful review papers of these instruments and my personal insights (might be just superficial understanding) of them.

## Life
During my spare time, I play table tennis (not professional, but not a rookie), go boulder at climbing gyms (SenderOne Westwood ~V6-V8 levels), or cook (?). Honestly as a PhD student, even though I'm living in one of the most popular city in the world, we don't play too much but study hard (seriously? prob NO). In the past, I was a 50/50 dog/cat person; ever since we had Cooby (literally Cool Baby) as our new family member on 2024/10/17, I'm 100% dog lover. Please go to this [page]() for witnessing Cooby's growing history.
