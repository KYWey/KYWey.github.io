# Sports
## Table Tennis
I started table tennis in my senior high school, and was addicted to it during undergraduate time. I was honored enough to represent the Physics Department Table Tennis Captain after the great leading by last captain ra_wu :) After joining UCLA in 2021, I continued as a club member and played junior varsity team in the past three years (Starting the 4th year, there's only scrimmage competition with other universities). I found that there are not many personal table tennis photos but here are some group photos!
## Climbing (mostly, indoor bouldering)
Short intro: basically there are indoor/outdoor bouldering (no rope, just climb a route), top rope (climb really high with fixed anchors), leading (climb really high and clip anchors by yourself). I don't want to die, so I mostly climb indoor; I'm scared of height, so I'm not interested in top rope or leading. Boudering is fun - it needs muscle, technique, and it's very good for making friends! I've uploaded some climbing videos on my XiaoHongShu (most of my climbing friends in LA use this, so I just follow them and share the happy moments with them!) Here are some screenshot photos (still uploading), and if you're interested in the whole videos please visit and follow me [here](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/641589970000000011021c49?xsec_token=YB4Rr4V3UcosH2iCwq3lZmizs3eJI2Bg4htBaJfUpVwg4=&xsec_source=app_share&xhsshare=CopyLink&appuid=641589970000000011021c49&apptime=1755455774&share_id=eb1584bcfa9e4770ba0e89f276a8a8d5)! Apparently it's in Chinese (Mandarin) but still welcom to stop by and just enjoy the videos!

# LA Family


# Cooby
As considerate and filial (lol) children, my sister and I found that after both of us went aboard to study PhD, my parents would be bored. Plus, our mom always loves dogs but she had to take care of us before. There was no doubt that we should convince our parents to have a pet!!! ok, maybe the only reason to stop them was that our dad was kind of afraid of dogs since during his childhood there were always random fierce dogs around their house. However, the fear went off immediately after he met Cooby &#9829; . They went to the puppy store and didn't hesitate to have Cooby even they just saw his video (how adorable he is!) Both my sister and I were so happe to see our parents with this lovely dog. I was very lucky to have the chance to go back to Taiwan to be with Cooby when he was about two months old and eight months old. Since his coming, we've recorded many many photos and videos of his funny and cute moments. I'm not sure if Cooby agrees with uploading his photos online, but here are some charming photos:
