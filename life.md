# LA Family
Without the mental support of my lovely close friends aka *family in LA*, I wouldn't still have such a strong mindset and happiness during PhD. Hearing many pepole complain about their research and personal life during PhD, I always feel more than grateful to randomly run into a Taiwanese in Target on my first week when I arrived in LA in 2021. Yes this might sould hilarious, but the story was that I was wearing a ㄅㄆㄇㄈ (Taiwanese spelling) T-shirt in the grocery store so a random guy (Peter Yeh) came to ask if I am Taiwanese. It was such an unforgettable oppurtunity that made me grap the chance to meet his friend Jane (using everyone's English name as one way to make people unidentified lol), who turned out to be the "Mom" of our LA Family. Jane has always been the most considerate, most comprehensive, most friendy, and most sophisticated person in our group, and she has been taking care of us so thoroughly through these years (big thanks and credits to her). This was just opening the first page of our whole story. I always want to document detailed diaries of our lifes, but XD, nope! If there's a chance I might give a link here which has many many our interesting stories and I hope one day when we're not living together anymore I can share with you.

However, on this page I still want to have basic intro to our members and say something to you. Tim and Peter (Wang), as the friends who I already knew in Taiwan, were trustworthy enough such that when I first came to the US I knew I wasn't along. Ok maybe Peter gave me more support then and Tim was only like ... casual(?), or indifferent to anything. Knowing Jane, Tim, and Peter(x2), we held a 18-people party on Sep.14 (ah ha I still remember this date) at Pearl&Karen's apartment - this then brought us the chance to know more people, including Cindy and Amelia. Long story short, thanks to their support from the very first year to this goddamm eternal PhD, I'm still barely surviving.

- Notes-1: Peter was smart enought to not study PhD and earned his Master degree after our first year - then he's making money and enjoying life now at Arizona. 
- Notes-2: Then from the second year we introduced our chubby Ben, who is the master of everything.
- Notes-3: Third year, Jessie joined this large family; even though she doesn't live with us (still pretty close), we hang out together really often.
- Notes-4: Ellen is the only one in our group (the messenger chat lol) I missed above, so I'm attaching this sentence here. <3

When I graduate if I have the opportuinity, I'd love to say one sentence to each of you (chronological order)

# Table Tennis
I started table tennis in my senior high school, and was addicted to it during undergraduate time. I was honored enough to represent the Physics Department Table Tennis Captain after the great leading by last captain ra_wu :) After joining UCLA in 2021, I continued as a club member and played junior varsity team in the past three years (Starting the 4th year, there's only scrimmage competition with other universities). I found that there are not many personal table tennis photos but here are some group photos!
# Climbing (mostly, indoor bouldering)
Short intro: basically there are indoor/outdoor bouldering (no rope, just climb a route), top rope (climb really high with fixed anchors), leading (climb really high and clip anchors by yourself). I don't want to die, so I mostly climb indoor; I'm scared of height, so I'm not interested in top rope or leading. Boudering is fun - it needs muscle, technique, and it's very good for making friends! I've uploaded some climbing videos on my XiaoHongShu (most of my climbing friends in LA use this, so I just follow them and share the happy moments with them!) Here are some screenshot photos (still uploading), and if you're interested in the whole videos please visit and follow me [here](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/641589970000000011021c49?xsec_token=YB4Rr4V3UcosH2iCwq3lZmizs3eJI2Bg4htBaJfUpVwg4=&xsec_source=app_share&xhsshare=CopyLink&appuid=641589970000000011021c49&apptime=1755455774&share_id=eb1584bcfa9e4770ba0e89f276a8a8d5)! Apparently it's in Chinese (Mandarin) but still welcom to stop by and just enjoy the videos!

# Cooby
As considerate and filial (lol) children, my sister and I found that after both of us went aboard to study PhD, my parents would be bored. Plus, our mom always loves dogs but she had to take care of us before. There was no doubt that we should convince our parents to have a pet!!! ok, maybe the only reason to stop them was that our dad was kind of afraid of dogs since during his childhood there were always random fierce dogs around their house. However, the fear went off immediately after he met Cooby &#9829; . They went to the puppy store and didn't hesitate to have Cooby even they just saw his video (how adorable he is!) Both my sister and I were so happe to see our parents with this lovely dog. I was very lucky to have the chance to go back to Taiwan to be with Cooby when he was about two months old and eight months old. Since his coming, we've recorded many many photos and videos of his funny and cute moments. I'm not sure if Cooby agrees with uploading his photos online, but here are some charming photos:
